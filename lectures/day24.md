# For an easy way to post notebooks: use gists. 

[Gists](https://github.com/blog/1276-welcome-to-a-new-gist)

I like Carl's use of gist.github.com to host IPython notebooks --
they are lightweight, easy to set up, and actually full git repos too. If you do use gists, 
continue to upload revisions of your notebook to the same gist.  (e.g., <https://gist.github.com/carlshan/5410596/revisions> )

#  Come to Class

I expect everyone to come to class for the remainder of the semester because getting a chance to talk even briefly is
really valuable for getting projects moving along. If you are absent, send me a note with an explanation why.

# Homework

Due Tuesday April 23, 2013, noon PDT:

* update [the Google docs for our projects](http://bit.ly/wwod13projideas) with the current status of your projects,
with answers to the questions:

1) What are you currently working on?
2) What are you planning to get done this week?
3) What are problems you need help with to take next steps on your project? 

* Update of your IPython notebook

* Break down who is working on what and what you plan to get done until the next class.
I want an email from each of you individually on what you are doing.
