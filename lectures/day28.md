# Grading

* I will take resubmissions of problem sets until May 7, 2013 6pm PDT.
* I will be grading projects next week (with help from Jacob).  I may be contacting you with follow-up questions.
* If you have a URL to your presentation slides, throw them into the [Abstracts](https://docs.google.com/a/berkeley.edu/document/d/1ZMZcai8k5YA-_re_ZWhdQFwTk0xmTbQP0UIaDlb72lE/edit#heading=h.fcxp78qp0qz) section.


# Invitation to Stay In Touch

* Feel free to reach out to me after the course is over.  I'd enjoy working with you all afterwards.
* I'd like to follow up on a lot of what we started on this course -- so if you want to work together to learn more, let me know.


# Expectations for Final Projects and Presentations (Repeated)

It might be helpful for me to write down what I have said in class about my expectations for the projects.

## Presentations 

In your presentation, I would like to see the following:

* a clear articulation of what problem you are solving with your project
* a clear description of what you proposed to do and what you ended up doing, describing what led you to go from what you proposed to what you ended up doing
* a description of what is behind-the-scenes: what sources of data are you drawing from and how you are analyzing your data
* if you were to continue your project beyond the course, what would you do
* (optionally) a quick demo of your project

# Final report

Your final iPython notebook is due at the beginning of class on Day 29 (May 7, 2013). I would
like both a digital and paper copy of your notebook.

In your report please include the following:

* a clear description of what you proposed to do and what you ended up doing, describing what led you to go from what you proposed to what you ended up doing

analyze your data.
* **a clear description of your results and how to reproduce your results.**
* if you were to continue your project beyond the course, what would you do
* a paragraph that outlines how you split the work among group members and which describes your individual contributions to the work.
