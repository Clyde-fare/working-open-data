# Project Abstracts and Open House

I will be advertising the Open House for the course at the end of this week. Please
provide me a title and a short blurb (minimally, 75 words and not more 150 words)
describing your project that I can use to advertise your work by **tomorrow**: **Friday,
April 26, 2013 at noon PDT**.

Place your project abstract at
[Abstracts](https://docs.google.com/a/berkeley.edu/document/d/1ZMZcai8k5YA-_re_ZWhdQFwTk0xmTbQP0UIaDlb72lE/edit#bookmark=id.zebdssfr8vuy)
section.

The Open House will be on 

    Tuesday, May 7 2-3:30pm

I'll be inviting people from the iSchool and the larger community. Feel free to
invite your friends to attend. Light refreshments will be served.

BTW, you might get a kick out of a video of the [Open House for Mixing and Remixing Information in 2008](http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/409703).
and [photos from 2006 MRI Open House](http://www.flickr.com/photos/raymondyee/sets/72057594137253915/).  It should be a lot of fun!

# Feedback on your IPython project notebooks

I'm looking for concrete code in IPython notebook. It's better to start with one
specific data set with some analytical code from which you then expand
than generalities about work you hope to accomplish.  In other words, consolidate and present what you have
and then work iteratively to improve that work. I
love to see you accomplish big ambitious goal but I want you to work reach those goals as a series of concrete,
probably modest steps.

Keep your section of http://bit.ly/wwod13projideas up-to-date --i.e, delete stuff that's no longer true.

# Homework

* Write abstract for projects.
* Prepare for presentations next week.
* Keep working on projects.
