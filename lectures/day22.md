# Agenda / Homework

Continue on the problem set due on Monday.  Fill in `segment_status` and run the notebook, showing the number of cores vs time for your run on PiCloud.  Send me
a URL to a public notebook (rendered in nbviewer.ipython.org).  Due Monday, April 15, 2013 at noon. e.g., [my notebook in my PiCloud account](https://s3.amazonaws.com/pi-user-buckets/bKkRFJzc0CNIRAkhn6P50MHLmNEqry24er6MOcOI/notebook/Day_21_CommonCrawl_Starter.ipynb)

Follow up problem:
    
* how to calculate the cost of the jobs on PiCloud
* how to extract the pdfs in the corpus?  How much will it cost?


# Juriscraper Workshop

Please let me know whether you will attend our Workshop on JuriScraper on
Friday, April 12, 2013 in Room 205 South Hall (1-3 pm with 3-4pm for die-hards.)
This is a great opportunity to learn about web scraping. Mike Lissner will be
there along with Brian Carver.

To retrieve a notebook we will use tomorrow:

    import urllib
    urllib.urlretrieve ("http://bit.ly/jsnotebook", "Day_22_juriscraper.ipynb")

# Next Steps

* Focus will be on projects.
* I'd like us to work on the problems that come up while you make progress on projects.  For example, [plotting counties](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/rdhyee/working-open-data/master/notebooks/Day_22_mapping_counties.ipynb), brought up because of student project.
* I'm also interested in helping you work with data in the longer term...that's why I think projects are important.
* Final products will be iPython notebooks that you write to be integrated into the Working Open Data repository -- we'll
use `git pull requests` and a community review process similar to what Fernando discussed.  (See https://vimeo.com/63250251 for
a video of his PyData 2013 keynote.)
* Final presentations will be on Tuesday, May 7 from 2-3:30pm.  Invite your friends!!
